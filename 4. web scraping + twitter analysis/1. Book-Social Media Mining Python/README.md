Setting up the environment

Requirements: Python 3.4+

It's strongly recommended to create a virtual environment, either with `virtualenv` or with `conda`. This section describes how to set-up the environment with `virtualenv`.

Get the book repo:

    git clone https://github.com/bonzanini/Book-SocialMediaMiningPython.git
    cd Book-SocialMediaMiningPython

Install/upgrade virtualenv (not needed on Python 3.4+):

    pip install -U virtualenv

Create the environment:

    virtualenv book_env

Activate the environment:

    source book_env/bin/activate

Install all the Python dependencies:

    pip install -r requirements.txt
